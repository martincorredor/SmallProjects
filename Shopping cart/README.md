## Shopping cart

In this project, I learn how to manipulate the DOM with vanilla JS

In the end, I will have an application that:
* list the products in cards
* the client can buy the product and indeed, the products are lying in the cart
* also if the product is repeated, only the amount is changed
* will be buttons to change the ammount of the products (Increase and decrease)
* also it can be emptied the shopping cart
* the total purchase will be displayed

### My progress with the app...
*0%* I'm going to start
